nQuake for Mac OS X
===================
To install nQuake, start Terminal by opening your Applications folder, and
then scroll down to Utilities, and double-click the Terminal icon.

If you downloaded nQuake to the ~/Downloads folder (default behaviour in
Mac OS X Snow Leopard), you will need to change directory to that folder
before proceeding.


$ cd ~/Downloads


Once this is done, you will need to extract the nQuake package.


$ tar xvzf nquake20_installer-macosx.tar.gz


The version of the installer may vary (in this case 20), so try typing nquake
and then pressing tab to let Terminal auto-complete the filename if you are
unsure.

Once you have extracted the package, change directory to the folder that was
created (same as the package but without .tar.gz), run the install script and
follow the instructions. You can use tab to auto-complete the folder name here
as well.


$ cd nquake20_installer-macosx/
$ ./install_nquake.sh


After choosing what mirror to use for downloading, simply sit back and enjoy
a sweet cup of coffee or a glass of orange juice while nQuake downloads and
installs all the components needed to play QuakeWorld.

After installation has completed, start QuakeWorld by browsing your way to
the nQuake folder (by default installed in /Applications/nQuake) using Finder,
and double-click the "EZQuake-GL" application icon.

If you are interested in playing the full Quake game (singleplayer), you need
to buy Quake. From the Quake installation, copy pak1.pak to /nQuake/id1/.

Thank you for downloading nQuake
